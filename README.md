USB CAM OTG (On The Go)
=======================

By: Eric Echeverri

USBCam mobile is a mobile application for Android devices that allows communication with a standard USB cam connected to the Android USB port and be used in a similar fashion that new vehicles use the rear view CAM. In a two months period the application has been installed 468 times. As a result of this, there is an initiative to create similar application in dental schools to use as graphic interface to show the patient using his/her own mobile device about the treatment or preventive work that needs to be done on behalf of the patient to keep with the indications and work prescribed by the doctor's visit by saving the images in his/her own mobile device. The following link takes you to the application up an running in the Google play market.

Reasons for success
===================

1. The application uses edge technology not yet understood and known by programmers and the market.

2. Programmers need a good understanding of low level programming - C programming, Java programming, USB libraries -- in order to communicate with USB cam devices and for this reason it is a technology few try to tackle because of the complexity of the programming layers.

3. The ability to narrow the application to a particular field -- Dental -- makes the programming unique and a close market for a successful business model.

4. Penetration - Model can be easily expanded in all the environments -- IOS , Android, Blackberry -- since all have the same USB interface.

5. Non existence of any application in dental field yet.

6. Could be used in remote areas to replace and improve dental hygiene where technology is very difficult to obtain due to the low financial resources to get dental equipment and edge technology.

7. I am the developer of that application, so the technology is understood by one of the team members. That will give us more chance for success.
